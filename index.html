        <h2 id="title1">A little more about me</h2> 
        <p id="firstpara">Hello, my name is Aya Hariri, I am belgian but I am originally from Syria.
        I am a freelance graphic designer and previously worked in the field of events. I have a secret addiction to
        McDonald's. I love playing video games during my freetime. My favorite game is Call of Duty. I have a fear of
        birds, especially crows, pigeons and small birds. This fear started when i was 13years old, I was in Paris
        having a sandwich, and a lot of birds came on my sandwich. Since then, I don't feel comfortable around birds!
        I love travelling, seeing nature all around the world. I love nature and beautiful landscapes, I feel like they
        enhance the presence and power of God. I love the beach, the ocean, although the deep sense of it scares me but
        I find it gorgeous in all its ways.
        </p>

        <p id="secondpara">I grew up with two older brothers who were very much into gaming, including my mother. She was obsessed with all Mario games on the SuperNintendo, back in the 90'. I love all sorts of games, whether Sudoku, or phone games, board games, video games, all kind of games basically! I enjoy the competition and let's me forget about everything and focus on the game. It's a great way to let loose. I love video games, and my favorite are the following; </p>
